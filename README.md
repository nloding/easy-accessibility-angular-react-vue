# Easy Accessibility with Angular, React, and Vue

## Accessibility is simple with Angular, React, and Vue. We will the basics of a11y with all three!

When discussing diversity and accessibility, frameworks are often used as scapegoats: “It’s too hard to do it with {{ framework_name_here }}”. It’s an excuse. Most modern frameworks are built with accessibility in mind, and implementing accessibility often takes no time at all. Achieving a baseline level of accessibility is more about changing how you think than it is changing how you code. After a brief introduction to accessibility and the web, we will tackle some of the most common accessibility patterns using Angular, React, and Vue, and explore some libraries that make accessibility even easier. Last, we will look at testing tools and strategies to ensure that accessibility isn’t overlooked.
